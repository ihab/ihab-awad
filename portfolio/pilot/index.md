I have loved airplanes since childbirth. Rather recently in life, I fulfilled my dream of flying an airplane.

## Origins

My dad was an aeronautical engineer, and when I was very young, he taught at the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Cairo. My earliest memory is of running around a belly-landed Beech 18 that was in the yard there, and getting lost....

In the 1950s, my dad spent a summer working at a factory in Egypt that built the Heliopolis Aircraft Works Gomhouriya, a re-engined copy of the [Bücker Bü 181 Bestmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCcker_B%C3%BC_181_Bestmann) trainer. I was raised on stories of the cool structural details of this airplnae, which was made primarily of wood with a plywood or fabric covering:
