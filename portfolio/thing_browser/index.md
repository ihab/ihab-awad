title: Thing Browser

Thing Browser was a project proposal I made early on in my tenure at Google, to recast the Web as a network of user composable distributed objects.

## The inspiration

As I describe under
[FavaBeans](/portfolio/work/favabeans/),
I am a big fan of object-oriented user interfaces. I expected the Web to be the most popular platform for distributed computing, and it was natural to imagine that each URL identifies a distributed object.

What if we could build these ideas into a Web browser, in such a way that plain HTML Web pages are just very simple distributed objects?
